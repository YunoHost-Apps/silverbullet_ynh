This version brings lots of internal reworks. After the upgrade, please make sure you reload all your SilverBullet tabs a few times, just to make sure the cache is flushed. If it does not work anyway, clear your cache and cookies through your browser.

Note that a full space reindex will automatically kick off, which — while ideally being faster, will still take some time. Caveat here (which I noticed randomly): If you have multiple tabs open with SilverBullet and some still run the old version, you end up in an infinite reindex cycle. Just close other tabs, or reload them to stop this from happening.
