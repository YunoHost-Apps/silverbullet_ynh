## Upgrade notes

- If you have third-party plugs installed and intend to reinstall them as Libraries: be sure to delete the old versions first. You can do so by cleaning out your `_plug` folder right on the file system, or use the document picker, filter on `plug.js` and delete every single document that’s in the `_plug` folder that way.
- Reminder: If you somehow end up in a state where SilverBullet doesn’t load properly, have a look at [Troubleshooting](https://silverbullet.md/Troubleshooting) for hints on what to try to fix it.
