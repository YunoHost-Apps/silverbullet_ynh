Silverbullet has been successfully upgraded. If you installed some [Plugs](https://silverbullet.md/Plugs), you'd better update them to avoid incompatibility issues.

To do so, in Silverbullet, you may either:
- open the Command Palette and run: `Plugs: Update`;
- or go to the [PLUGS](https://__DOMAIN__/PLUGS) page and hit the `Plugs: Update` button;
